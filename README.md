# About
This is a sample implementation of using your CommandPost account to verify entries to contests, giveaways, promotions, etc.
via Social OAuth connections.

## Installation
Only web server is needed to "run" this sample.  Add the two HTML files to your web server and load up `index.html`. No 
social credentials are shared when using this example.

## Usage
You can utilize the _Mock Response_ option without an active [CommandPost](http://getcommandpost.com) account or an active
promotion (created using your CommandPost account).

## Issues
Please use Github issues, if you have issues to report with the PromoEntryVerificationExample code.  Contact us directly
at support@cmp.ly for assistance with using your CommandPost account or sales@cmp.ly to get started today.
